        <h1>PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION</h1>

The response to the first and second editions of Python Course has 
been overwhelmingly positive. More than one million copies are in print, 
including translations in over 10 languages. I’ve received letters and emails 
from readers as young as 10, as well as from retirees who want to learn to 
program in their free time. Python Crash Course is being used in middle 
schools and high schools, and also in college classes. Students who are 
assigned more advanced textbooks are using Python Crash Course as a com
panion text for their classes and finding it a worthwhile supplement. People 
are using it to enhance their skills on the job, change careers, and start 
working on their own side projects. In short, people are using the book for 
the full range of purposes I had hoped they would, and much more.
The opportunity to write a third edition of Python Crash Course has been 
thoroughly enjoyable. Although Python is a mature language, it continues to 
evolve as every language does. My main goal in revising the book is to keep 
it a well-curated introductory Python course. By reading this book, you’ll 
learn everything you need to start working on your own projects, and you’ll 
build a solid foundation for all of your future learning as well. I’ve updated 
some sections to reflect newer, simpler ways of doing things in Python. I’ve 
also clarified some sections where certain details of the language were not 
presented as accurately as they could have been. All the projects have been 
completely updated using popular, well-maintained libraries that you can 
confidently use to build your own projects.
The following is a summary of specific changes that have been made in
